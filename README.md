Host app for the WebExtension **[PassFF](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/passff)**

### Overview
This piece of software wraps around the **[zx2c4 pass](http://www.zx2c4.com/projects/password-store/)** shell command. It has to be installed for the PassFF browser extension to work properly.

### Dependencies

#### For the host application
* [`python3`](https://docs.python.org/3.6/) (>= 3.6)
* [`pass`](https://www.passwordstore.org/)

#### For the install script (except Windows)
* `curl`
* `sed`

### Installation

#### Linux, MacOS, * BSD

Download the latest `install_host_app.sh` script from [our releases page](https://github.com/passff/passff-host/releases) and execute it. As an example, Firefox users can do this in one line like so:

```
$ VERSION=1.2.0
$ curl -sSL https://github.com/passff/passff-host/releases/download/${VERSION}/install_host_app.sh | bash -s -- firefox
```

Users of other supported browsers need to replace the last argument (`firefox`) by `chrome`, `opera`, `chromium` or `vivaldi`.
The script will download the host application (a small python script) and the add-on's manifest file (a JSON config file) and put them in the right place.
If you're concerned about executing a script that downloads files from the web, you can download the files yourself and run the script with the `--local` option instead or link the files yourself. Details below.

#### Windows
Download the `install_host_app.bat` script from [our releases page](https://github.com/passff/passff-host/releases) and execute it from within a shell with a correct PATH, mentioning your browser in the last argument (i.e., replace `firefox` by `chrome`, `opera`, `chromium` or `vivaldi` if necessary).
*The rule of thumb is: if you can execute pass and python from your shell, then your host application will be installed correctly.*

```
> install_host_app.bat firefox
```

Note: Older Windows versions might require powershell to be installed manually as the install script uses powershell internally. Windows 10 users should be fine out of the box.

#### Latest from GitHub
This is not recommended! Only for developers and for testing purposes!

Clone the repository. Then, run the following command.

```
$ make [VERSION=testing|...] [BROWSER=firefox|chrome|opera|chromium|vivaldi] install
```

This will generate the host application and installation scripts for the given `VERSION` (`testing` by default), and copy the host application and manifest files to the right place for your `BROWSER` (`firefox` by default).

This uses the `--local` option of the `install_host_app.sh` script, which instructs it to use the files on disk rather than downloading them from GitHub.

If this doesn't work, you can link the files yourself. First, change the `path` value in the `passff.json` file to be the absolute path to the project's `bin/testing/passff.py` file. Then symlink (or copy) the file `bin/testing/passff.json` to the appropriate location for your browser and OS:

### Troubleshooting

#### Script execution failed
#### Connection to the host app failed or returned an unexpected result

> Connection to the host app failed or returned an unexpected result!
> Make sure you have the latest version of the PassFF host app installed by following the installation instructions on GitHub.

> Script execution failed.

You get one of these error messages? Follow the instructions below!

###### Remove old installations
*Inappropriate installations can override another one that could work. So, it is simpler to remove everything and restart from scratch.*
* Delete any file `passff.json` in the folders `native-messaging-hosts` and `NativeMessagingHosts`
  * For the complete paths of these folders for your OS and browser, see the section above.
* Verify all `passff.json` are deleted by doing a search.
  * Use your best file searching tool. For example: `find / -type f -name 'passff.json'`

###### Reinstall the host application
See the section above.

###### Check that the host application is correctly installed
* Make sure the file `passff.py` is executable
  * `ls -l /path/to/passff.py`
* Open `passff.json` and verify `path` is set to the absolute path of the host executable `passff.py`: for example `"path": "/path/to/passff.py"`

#### PassFF's host application is not working and takes 99% CPU

###### Set a correct PATH in the `passff.py` script
When the PATH variable is not set correctly, `pass` will complain about not finding `getopt` and then loop forever. You can reproduce this behavior on the command line:
```
PATH="$(which bash | xargs dirname)" $(which pass)
```

### Advanced Troubleshooting
If nothing above has worked out your issue...

#### Gather information in the web browser
In the preferences of PassFF, you can enable the status bar and debug logs in the Web Console (to open the console: Ctrl+Shift+K in Firefox, Ctrl+Shift+J in Chrome/Chromium). Enable the debugging mode in `about:debugging`, and reload the app.

#### Make sure the version of the host application is supported by PassFF
* Open the `passff.py` file to find its version number
  * `head /path/to/passff.py`

#### Check the output of the host app
* Run `echo -e "\x02\x00\x00\x00[]" | /path/to/passff.py | tail -c +4; echo`
* The typical output for an empty store is:
  * `{"stderr": "", "version": "1.0.1", "exitCode": 0, "stdout": "Password Store\n"}`

#### Testing OTP support
```console
$ echo -e "\x19\x00\x00\x00[\"otp\",\"/www/github.com\"]" | /path/to/passff.py | tail -c +4; echo
{"exitCode": 0, "stderr": "", "stdout": "123456\n", "version": "1.0.1"}
```

### Preferences
If you use a customized `pass` installation: environment variables, customized repository path or extensions, you may have to customize the *preferences section* in `passff.py`.

By modifying the *preferences section* in `passff.py`, you will be able to set:
  - `COMMAND`: the path to the `pass` script,
  - `COMMAND_ARGS`: additional command line arguments that are passed to `pass`,
  - `COMMAND_ENV`: additional environment variables,
  - `CHARSET`: the shell stdout charset.
